    <h2>1 - Autonomous Vehicle with Obstacle Avoidance</h2>
    <div class="project-content">
      <div class="text-section">
        <p>
          This project involves developing an autonomous vehicle designed to navigate its surroundings and avoid
          obstacles
          using an ultrasonic sensor. The vehicle is powered by Arduino, utilizes the SR04 library for distance
          measurement,
          and is programmed in the Arduino language. It uses sensors and motors to detect obstacles and respond by
          moving
          forward, turning, or stopping based on set thresholds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key components include an Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors, motors, and a servo motor. Despite challenges, such
          as
          motor limitations, the project successfully demonstrated the potential of sensors and programming in creating
          autonomous systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          This work highlights applications in improving traffic flow, reducing accidents, and inspiring further
          research in
          autonomous technologies.

    <h2>2 - Smart Home Automation System</h2>
    <div class="project-content">
      <div class="text-section">
        <p>
          This project focuses on enhancing safety and accessibility in modern homes through the integration of embedded
          sensors. The system features four key sensors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Temperature Sensor:</strong> Monitors room temperature in real-time and adjusts fan or air
            conditioning speed.</li>
          <li><strong>Gas Sensor:</strong> Detects flammable gases, such as methane, and alerts the user in case of a
            leak.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Water Sensor:</strong> Monitors water levels in tanks, detects rain, and signals the user to close
            openings to prevent leaks.</li>
          <li><strong>Moisture Sensor:</strong> Tracks soil moisture levels and notifies the user when plants need
            watering.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The system consolidates all sensor data into a single LCD display for easy access. Additionally, it includes a
          hex
          keypad-based locking mechanism for enhanced security.
        </p>
        <p>
          This prototype demonstrates the potential of embedded systems to improve home safety, resource management, and
          user convenience. Future improvements could include additional sensors and remote monitoring capabilities via
          mobile applications.
